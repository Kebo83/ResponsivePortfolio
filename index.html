              <p> My name is Johnny Keith Jones.
                   I am originally from Boaz, Alabama.
                   I love watching and playing sports.
                   My favorites sports are baseball and football.
                   I am huge Alabama college football fan!! 
                   ROLL TIDE ROLL!! 
                   I also cheer for the AZ home team, The Arizona Diamondbacks. 
                   I enjoy hiking, camping, fishing, playing sorftball, and doing about anything else the outdoors has to offer.
                   I am a first generation college graduate.
                   I graduted with a BS in Electronics Engeering Technology. 
                   I was in the Navy Reserve as an Information System Technologist for 4 years.
                   I moved to Arizona in 2009 to work as an Engineer with Lockheed Martin.
                   To help move up with the company I started volunteering to train soldiers on the military equipment I worked on.
                   I fell in love with sharing teaching and sharing knowlege.
                   I worked 5 years as Techinical Trainer with a few different companies.
                   After the last company was bought out, I went to work at State Farm working auto claims and trying to get into the training side of the business.
                   After a year I realized that getting into in the training department was nearly impossible.
                   I have since decided that learning to code, would not only be a new challege, but would also get me back into the technology field.</p>
        <p1>&nbsp;</p1>
        <p2>   I have a wonderful girlfriend that I have been dating for 5 1/2 years.
               Her name is Nichole and she just recently graduated as school teacher.
               I tell her all the time she is smarter than I am, because she finnished with a perfect 4.0 GPA, all while working fulltime.
               We have two awesome doggies that also like doing anything outside when I'm around and able to be with them.
               Kodiak and Papi are their names. 
               Nichole has had Kodiak ever since she was a puppy and bottle fed her until she could eat puppy food.
               Kodiak is the nicest Chow-Chow you have ever met until you mess with Nichole or myself.
               Kodiak has just turned 10 years old is starting to get a little grouchy at her old age.
               We adopted Papi a little over a year ago and he is our 50lb lap doggie
               He is a little timid and doesn't like to try new things.
               His favorite place is anywhere he can snuggle up to Nichole or myself.
               Nichole has done an awesome job teaching them both tricks.
               They both know how to sit, speak, stay, lay, play dead, and shake.</p2>
